# Slormancer-Forge-Selector
Challenge Selector for the Forge in Slormancer using weighted image matching. Adds the weight for the challenge and rewards together to come up with a selection.

If the image matching isn't working you will have to capture your own images and replace them. If I'm missing challenges and/or images you will have to add those.
